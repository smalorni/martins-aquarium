                                            <p> The salinity increases as the water volume decreases when evaporation occurs in your aquarium. As a solution, replace the evaporated water with an equal volume of purified fresh water will keep the salinity at the appropriate amount that you need it. However, don't let too much time elapses between top offs because the longer you wait, the steeper the fluctuation in salinity will be. Freshwater top offs should be a daily occurrence.</p>
                                            <br>
    
                                            <p>If you replace salt water, it must exactly match the same amount of salinity as the dirty water that you will be removing. Measurements are not always accurate so I advise you to let the water sit overnight while it is being heated to match your tank's temperature and aerated. Don't forget to test it before using the water then carefully make some adjustments as needed.</p>

                                            <p>It is essential to maintain temperature control to keep your fish alive and comfortable. If you don't, negative consequences can occur such as:</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Chemical balance can be changed by algae growth or plant decay</li>
                                                <li>Bacteria growth can lead to illnesses or death of fish</li>
                                                <li>Water oxygenation levels can be life-threatening to your fish</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>To regulate and maintain the aquarium tank's temperature, use a thermometer to monitor, invest in a high quality heater, consider a chiller, add properly balanced conditioned water to the tank to maintain constant water level and positioned the tank carefully in your home. Think about the room layout. I advised you to keep your tank away from windows and drafty areas or fans which impacts the temperature as well. You can prevent temperature fluctuations if you follow all of my wise tips.</p>
